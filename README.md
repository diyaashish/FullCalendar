# FullCalendar

The project aims to develop an interactive calendar application using the FullCalendar library in JavaScript. It utilizes various plugins provided by FullCalendar to enhance the functionality and visual representation of the calendar. The JavaScript code snippet initializes the calendar by creating an instance of the FullCalendar.Calendar class and configuring it with options such as time zone, theme system (bootstrap), header layout, week numbers, event limits, and event data source. The rendered calendar integrates different views like month, week, day, and list. The FullCalendar library simplifies the process of creating a feature-rich calendar with a user-friendly interface.
